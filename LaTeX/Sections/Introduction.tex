\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Electric power systems increasingly rely on fast-acting flexible resources to maintain
frequency quality as renewable energy sources displace traditional synchronous generation 
\autocite{caiLowInertiaPower2023} (Figure \ref{fig:dnv-electricity-supply-by-source}).
In the Nordic power markets, manual Frequency Restoration Reserves (mFRR) are activated
to correct sustained imbalances after other faster reserves have been utilized, such as
Frequency Containment Reserves (FCR) and automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR).
This results in a hierarchical reserve structure where mFRR serves as the last line of 
defense against frequency deviations \autocite{entso-eNoricBalancingPhilosophy2024}. 
mFRR activations are, therefore, relatively 
infrequent and often substantial when they do occur.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Motivation}
Since mFRR activations are infrequent but significant events in power system operation,
accurately predicting their occurrence would provide substantial benefits. For aggregators
of distributed flexible resources, such as home batteries and electric vehicles,
knowing when mFRR activations are likely to occur can inform bidding strategies in
the electricity balancing markets. Capacity markets and activation markets exist side by side,
each with distinct revenue opportunities. Capacity markets reward participants for being available
to provide reserves, while activation markets compensate for actual reserve activations. 
Accepted bids in capacity markets guarantees revenue regardless of whether an activation
occurs, while activation market bids only yield revenue upon actual activations. 
Bidding strategies involving activation markets are inherently riskier, as revenue 
realization is uncertain. 


    

If an aggregator is able to anticipate when mFRR
activations are unlikely, the aggregator can confidently bid their resources into
the capacity markets without the fear of missing out on high-value activation 
opportunities. Conversely, if an mFRR activation is predicted to be likely, the
aggregator might prioritize bidding into the activation market to capitalize on
potential revenues. Thus, a reliable prediction model for mFRR activations can enhance
market participation strategies and optimize revenue streams for aggregators of
flexible resources. 



The recent reform of the mFRR market in March 2025, transitioning to a Nordic-wide
mFRR activation market with quarter-hourly resolution 
\autocite{ConfirmationMFRREAM2025}, further motivates the
development of a data-driven prediction model. The increased granularity provides
more abundant data points for model training and evaluation, potentially improving
prediction quality. Additionally, the reform introduces more nuanced price signals,
which in theory could be captured by a well-designed prediction model. However,
as the transition is recent at the time of writing, there is limited historical data
available at the new resolution. This scarcity of data presents a challenge for
model development, as machine learning models typically require substantial amounts
of data to learn effectively.

\textbf{not only looking into prices and volumes.}



The aim of this specialization project is, thereby, to provide further work with
a mFRR activation prediction model that can be applied to comprehensive and
realistic market strategies for aggregators of distributed flexible resources.
One possability is to apply reinforcement learning techniques to develop 
near-optimal bidding strategies based on the predictions from the model. This is
an interesting avenue for future research as it, if successful, could provide
significant economic benefits for aggregators and enhance the overall efficiency
of the electricity balancing markets.

\subsection{Research Question}

The central research question of this study is: How well can mFRR up- and 
down-regulation activations be predicted  at 15-minute resolution using only 
real-time-available system state features and historical activation/price data?
What is the relative contribution of these systemic features compared to lag-based
features?
