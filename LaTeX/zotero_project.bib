Simultaneously, traditional frequency regulation resources will become insufficient with the reduction of online capacity of thermal units. These trends both lead to a decrease in the performance of power system frequency regulation. The planning of power system generation, particularly frequency regulation resources, will significantly influence the future quality of frequency. This paper proposes a frequency-constrained generation planning method under a high-proportion renewable energy system. The performance of power system frequency regulation is analyzed based on the simulation of the load-frequency control dynamics, where both the frequency regulation from conventional generation and renewable energy are taken into consideration. Non-linear frequency constraints are extracted from the generated data set, and then embedded into the power system planning model by utilizing a sparse weighted oblique decision tree. The case study on HRP-38 system validates the effectiveness of the method. The influence of renewable energy frequency regulation on unit commitment is also investigated.}

The participation factors are employed to generate adjustable generation outputs and ensure energy balance. The proposed robust optimization model can be equivalently transformed into a large-scale linear programming model with a huge number of dummy variables and additional constraints that challenge real-time markets. To further reduce the computation burden, the redundant constraint reduction strategy is proposed to fast eliminate redundant transmission security constraints before solving the model. The results from the IEEE 30-bus system with two wind farms show that the proposed robust joint optimization model provides a better solution compared to those cases using sequential dispatch or deterministic dispatch methodologies. Additional results from practical large-scale systems suggest that the number of redundant constraints is less than 6\%, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed redundant constraint reduction strategy in improving the computation efficiency of the robust joint dispatch in real-time markets.},

Experiments reveal that our multi-layer combination of many models offers better use of allocated training time than seeking out the best. A second contribution is an extensive evaluation of public and commercial AutoML platforms including TPOT, H2O, AutoWEKA, auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and Google AutoML Tables. Tests on a suite of 50 classification and regression tasks from Kaggle and the OpenML AutoML Benchmark reveal that AutoGluon is faster, more robust, and much more accurate. We find that AutoGluon often even outperforms the best-in-hindsight combination of all of its competitors. In two popular Kaggle competitions, AutoGluon beat 99\% of the participating data scientists after merely 4h of training on the raw data.},

Growing use of intermittent energy sources increases uncertainty in system operation and new EU regulations, including a so-called Activation Optimization Function and new Standard Products for manual frequency restoration reserves (mFRR), will change the activation process significantly. However, commonly used price-based bid selection approaches are incapable of taking intertemporal constraints and uncertainty into account in the activation process. This paper presents a new optimization formulation, built on stochastic unit commitment principles, using imbalance forecast scenarios to propose bid activation schedules minimizing expected activation costs. Unlike earlier approaches, intertemporal characteristics of the proposed mFRR product are modeled in detail. The optimization procedure is implemented in a rolling horizon simulation and demonstrated using Norwegian imbalance and market data. Compared to a corresponding deterministic approach, the stochastic strategy significantly reduces activation costs.},

Shorter MTUs and shorter gate closures lower the entrance barriers of demand side aggregators that face significant uncertainty on longer time scales. We study the business case for aggregated EV fleets participating in the Nordic 15-minute mFRR Energy Activation Market (EAM). Motivated by increasing system granularity and rapid EV uptake, we represent fleet flexibility as a virtual battery with time-varying power and energy envelopes and formulate a risk-aware stochastic optimisation that co-ordinates day-ahead scheduling with quarter-hour mFRR bidding. Using synthetic residential charging cohorts and observed day-ahead prices on two stylised days, we compare an independent day-ahead baseline to a co-optimised strategy under conservative availability and a CVaR-augmented objective. Across both price cases, co-optimisation increases expected profit and lowers downside risk: the model buys less energy day-ahead and shifts procurement toward mFRR down while flattening the charging plan to retain eligibility for mFRR up. Profit decomposition shows that the uplift is driven by higher mFRR down revenues and reduced reliance on unwinding day-ahead positions. We discuss operational implications for bidding and outline two extensions: rolling 45-minute re-optimisation and a V2G framework.},

  abstract = {The balancing energy market is the last of multiple markets that ensure the equilibrium of electricity production and demand. It is the mechanism through which mFRR activations are procured and balances the power system within the operational hour. This thesis analyses the market design and turnout to establish a description of the balancing energy market, how does its turnout behave, and how can it be modelled. First, a literature review establishes the market rules, main design parameters and key stakeholders in the Nordic balancing energy markets, as well as main future drivers of change. Then, the characteristics of the Finnish market turnout during 2018-2022 are described with statistical data analysis. Finally, a modelling methodology for volume and premium is proposed for long-term scenario generation purposes. The balancing energy market is a real-time market with asymmetrical, marginal pricing. The Nordic synchronous grid has a common merit order with multiple market areas. The three main market actors are the System Operators, the Balancing Service Providers, and the Balancing Responsible Parties. Future drivers include planned market reforms and increasing electricity demand and variable renewable energy. The analysis shows a small market, with a growing trend in both volume and premium. Seasonality was detected at hourly and monthly level. Volume was found to be distributed consistent to a random variable. Correlations were discovered between volume and premium, but also to day-ahead price and interconnector usage, and a weak but increasing correlation to wind power. No significant increase in correlation was detected when comparing the Finnish versus Nordic level of variables. The proposed model performs acceptably when compared to historic data but does not capture all characteristics of the turnout. Further research is proposed to better capture the characteristics of the balancing energy market.},

This change aims to reduce structural imbalances caused by mismatches between discrete power schedules and continuously varying demand, which lead to inefficient reserve activation, frequency deviations, and increased balancing costs. In this paper, we employ a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model for market clearing and compare the results of the balancing stage with a continuous-time balancing approach. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of increasing time resolution and assess whether further granularity provides additional benefits. Our results show that higher time resolution and continuous modeling reduce the need for balancing reserves by better approximating real load variations. These findings provide valuable insights for system operators to improve power plant ramping strategies and reserve allocation, ultimately enhancing system stability and reducing operational costs in future power systems.},

The models are benchmarked both for 1~h-ahead and day-ahead forecast, and both point and interval forecasts are compared. None of the benchmarked models produce informative day-ahead point forecasts, suggesting that information available before the closing of the day-ahead market is efficiently reflected in the day-ahead market price rather than the balancing market price. Evaluation of the interval forecasts reveals that models without balancing state information overestimate variance, making them unsuitable for scenario generation.},

This article investigates the gain of coordinating price-taking bids to the day-ahead electricity market (DA) and sequentially cleared energy-only markets, such as the Nordic balancing market (BM). A technically detailed case study from the Nordic market is presented. We find that coordinated bidding is hardly worthwhile under current market conditions, but that only a modest increase in the demand for balancing energy will make coordination profitable. If the supply curve for balancing energy is convex, so that the cost of balancing energy is asymmetric, the gains will be even higher. Finally, we find that day-ahead market bid curves that result from coordinated instances provide extra supply at low prices, and lower supply at high prices, compared to sequential bids. This is rational given the anticipated opportunities that the balancing market offers; however, it makes day-ahead bidding appear to exploit market power.},

Even with today's advanced computer technologies (e. g. , machine learning and data mining sys tems), discovering knowledge from data can still be fiendishly hard due to the characteristics of the computer generated data. Taking its simplest form, raw data are represented in feature-values. The size of a dataset can be measUJ{$\cdot$}ed in two dimensions, number of features (N) and number of instances (P). Both Nand P can be enormously large. This enormity may cause serious problems to many data mining systems. Feature selection is one of the long existing methods that deal with these problems. Its objective is to select a minimal subset of features according to some reasonable criteria so that the original task can be achieved equally well, if not better. By choosing a minimal subset offeatures, irrelevant and redundant features are removed according to the criterion. When N is reduced, the data space shrinks and in a sense, the data set is now a better representative of the whole data population. If necessary, the reduction of N can also give rise to the reduction of P by eliminating duplicates.},

The purpose of the model is simulation of prices to construct scenario trees representing possible realization of the stochastic prices. Such scenario trees can be used in planning models based on stochastic optimization to generate bid sequences to the balancing market. The spread of the prices in the tree and the shape of the scenarios are of central importance. Model parameter estimation methods reflecting the demands on scenario trees have therefore been used. The proposed model is also applied to data from the Nordic power market. The conclusion of this paper is that the developed model is appropriate for modeling real-time balancing power prices.},

Our core methodology is further adapted in order to minimize inter-zonal flows and in order to split reserve requirements between automatic and manual frequency restoration reserves. We apply our methodology to the problem of sizing reserves in the four load frequency control areas of the Swedish power system.

  abstract = {Shift of the power system generation from the fossil to the variable renewables prompted the system operators to search for new sources of flexibility, i.e., new reserve providers. With the introduction of electric vehicles, smart charging emerged as one of the promising solutions. However, electric vehicle aggregators face the uncertainty both on the reserve activation and the electric vehicle availability. These uncertainties can have a detrimental effect on both the aggregators' profitability and users' comfort. State-of-the art literature mostly neglects the reserve activation or it's uncertainty. On top of that, they rarely model European markets which are different that those commonly addressed in the literature. This paper introduces a new method for modeling the reserve activation uncertainty, also termed as balancing energy procurement in the European context, based on the real historic data from the European power system. Three electric vehicle scheduling models were designed and tested: the deterministic, the stochastic and the robust. The results demonstrate that the current deterministic approaches inaccurately represent the activation uncertainty and that the proposed models that consider uncertainty, both the stochastic and the robust, substantially improve the results. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis for the robust model was performed and it demonstrates how a decision-maker can choose its level of conservativeness, portraying its risk-awareness.},

In Europe, system operators are adjusting ancillary services markets to allow entrance of new players. Reserves are the first ones to be liberalized and one of their potential providers are electric vehicles. They can decrease their charging costs through reserve provision under negligible affect on users comfort. However, reserves are highly intertwined with uncertainty and depend on many parameters. To adequately address these uncertainties and safely bid in the markets, an aggregator must adequately integrate them in its optimal bidding algorithm. In this paper, a new robust model is proposed where a tight uncertainty set of reserve activation is created using a realistic reserve activation dataset. The tight robust framework is analysed on the electric vehicle feet operation under one aggregator. A sensitivity analysis is performed to find adequate boundaries of the uncertainty set. The results show that robust approach can be used to adequately address this uncertainty allowing the aggregator to choose its risk exposure and hedging strategy. Also, the results show that neglecting more than 1\% of the most extreme activation volumes could lead towards too liberal models not securing the battery limits adequately.},

This study proposes a two-stage probabilistic framework for the prediction of system imbalance and imbalance price. In the first stage, the quantiles of system imbalance are predicted employing the Quantile Regression Forest algorithm. In the second stage, the quantiles are leveraged to predict the imbalance prices, given the observed correlation between the system imbalance and the imbalance prices. The corresponding imbalance prices for each 15-minute interval are then predicted utilizing a novel methodology that combines Gradient Boosting with Markov switching models. The proposed methodology was evaluated using real data from the Greek balancing market. Comparative analysis with alternative models including a persistence model, Quantile Linear Regression, Long Short-Term Memory, and Quantile Regression Forest reveals that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the rest in terms of forecast accuracy. Specifically, the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms all alternative methods, achieving an 9\% improvement in nMAE and a 10.8\% reduction in CRPS with respect to the second best method (Quantile Regression Forest). The findings suggest that this approach can significantly improve the decision-making process for market participants, helping mitigate the financial risks associated with imbalance prices.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the use of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), an ensemble-tree-based machine learning (ML) algorithm, for short-term forecasting of manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR) activation direction and imbalance prices in the SE2 price area of the Nordic electricity market. With growing electrification, a rising share of renewables and strain from the ongoing energy crisis, the ability to anticipate balancing needs has become both more critical and more complex. Despite its practical importance, this problem has been relatively underexplored in the academic literature. The objective of this study is to assess how ML can support Intraday (ID) decision-making and improve predictive capabilities. To achieve this, a two-stage forecasting framework was developed using XGBoost, with the first stage classifying the expected direction of mFRR activation (upregulated, downregulated or unregulated), and the second stage predicting the corresponding imbalance price. The models were trained on data collected between May 2022 and February 2025 and evaluated across multiple forecasting horizons. By systematically testing preprocessing techniques, data availability, model configurations and feature sets and validating assumptions through domain knowledge, this study makes valuable contributions to the field. The results demonstrate that creating a model with normalized transmission flows, including forecasting error features, and data from SE1, SE2, SE3 and NO4 yielded the best results. Forward filling for missing values, avoiding outlier removal, applying simple ordinal time encoding, and relying on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection further improved performance. Leveraging a wide set of features and optimizing hyperparameters through Bayesian optimization, enhanced model performance. More specifically, the classification model achieved {$FF$}1{$mmmmmmmmmm$} scores of 0.805, 0.611 and 0.531 for one-, two- and three-hour ahead forecasts. While predictive performance declined at longer horizons, class-specific Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) scores indicated that meaningful signals were retained up to five hours into the future and that prediction thresholds could be further optimized per class. With regards to the imbalance price model, one-hour forecasts yielded acceptable results. This model reached a Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) of 0.366 and a Coefficient of Determination ({$RR$}2) of 0.667 for the one-hour ahead forecast. Overall, the study concludes that XGBoost models, supported by rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection and hyperparameter optimization, can provide valuable short-term forecasts in the context of imbalance prediction.},

In this paper, the nature of time series data and missingness mechanisms are described to help identify which imputation method should be used to impute missing data, along with a review of imputation methods and how they work. Recommended methods from literature are used to impute synthetic data of different nature and the results are discussed. In addition, a case study concerning the prediction (classification) of US market instability (BEAR or BULL) using a data set with mixed missingness mechanisms and mixed nature is presented to evaluate how different types of imputation methods can affect the final results of the classification task.},

  abstract = {Power system balancing becomes ever-challenging due to the increasing penetration of uncertain renewable energy sources. Therefore, balancing markets are implemented in various power markets and such markets play a crucial role in ensuring balanced system operation. The optimal operation of balancing market necessitates accurate imbalance volume forecasts. However, imbalance volume forecasting got less research attention. Also, most of the existing imbalance volume forecasting models do not use specific input selection or data preprocessing techniques. These techniques can help to improve forecasting accuracy. Further, balancing market operations necessitates short-term forecasts. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel dynamic regression-based Trigonometric Seasonal, Yeo-Johnson Transformation, ARMA residuals, Trend, and Seasonality (TYJATS) forecasting model to obtain accurate short-term imbalance volume forecasts. The proposed forecasting model dynamically updates data at each time step, effectively handling seasonality and nonlinearity. It uses Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) for input data selection and the tsrobprep package for data preprocessing. Further, a Newton--Raphson-based optimizer (NRBO) is proposed to minimize the balancing costs. The proposed model is tested on the data collected from the Belgian market. The forecasting analysis demonstrates that the proposed model improves accuracy by 59.85\%, 42.61\%, and 39.56\% compared to machine learning (long short-term memory), regression (auto-regressive distributed lag), and Transmission System Operator (TSO)-based forecasting, respectively. Furthermore, integrating the proposed forecasting model into balancing market optimization results in the least balancing cost, achieving savings of 44.51\% compared to TSO-based forecasting.},

  abstract = {Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed. Additional resources related to event prediction are included in the paper website: http://cs.emory.edu/{$\sim$}lzhao41/projects/event\_prediction\_site.html.},
