Simultaneously, traditional frequency regulation resources will become insufficient with the reduction of online capacity of thermal units. These trends both lead to a decrease in the performance of power system frequency regulation. The planning of power system generation, particularly frequency regulation resources, will significantly influence the future quality of frequency. This paper proposes a frequency-constrained generation planning method under a high-proportion renewable energy system. The performance of power system frequency regulation is analyzed based on the simulation of the load-frequency control dynamics, where both the frequency regulation from conventional generation and renewable energy are taken into consideration. Non-linear frequency constraints are extracted from the generated data set, and then embedded into the power system planning model by utilizing a sparse weighted oblique decision tree. The case study on HRP-38 system validates the effectiveness of the method. The influence of renewable energy frequency regulation on unit commitment is also investigated.}

Shorter MTUs and shorter gate closures lower the entrance barriers of demand side aggregators that face significant uncertainty on longer time scales. We study the business case for aggregated EV fleets participating in the Nordic 15-minute mFRR Energy Activation Market (EAM). Motivated by increasing system granularity and rapid EV uptake, we represent fleet flexibility as a virtual battery with time-varying power and energy envelopes and formulate a risk-aware stochastic optimisation that co-ordinates day-ahead scheduling with quarter-hour mFRR bidding. Using synthetic residential charging cohorts and observed day-ahead prices on two stylised days, we compare an independent day-ahead baseline to a co-optimised strategy under conservative availability and a CVaR-augmented objective. Across both price cases, co-optimisation increases expected profit and lowers downside risk: the model buys less energy day-ahead and shifts procurement toward mFRR down while flattening the charging plan to retain eligibility for mFRR up. Profit decomposition shows that the uplift is driven by higher mFRR down revenues and reduced reliance on unwinding day-ahead positions. We discuss operational implications for bidding and outline two extensions: rolling 45-minute re-optimisation and a V2G framework.},

This change aims to reduce structural imbalances caused by mismatches between discrete power schedules and continuously varying demand, which lead to inefficient reserve activation, frequency deviations, and increased balancing costs. In this paper, we employ a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model for market clearing and compare the results of the balancing stage with a continuous-time balancing approach. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of increasing time resolution and assess whether further granularity provides additional benefits. Our results show that higher time resolution and continuous modeling reduce the need for balancing reserves by better approximating real load variations. These findings provide valuable insights for system operators to improve power plant ramping strategies and reserve allocation, ultimately enhancing system stability and reducing operational costs in future power systems.},

This article investigates the gain of coordinating price-taking bids to the day-ahead electricity market (DA) and sequentially cleared energy-only markets, such as the Nordic balancing market (BM). A technically detailed case study from the Nordic market is presented. We find that coordinated bidding is hardly worthwhile under current market conditions, but that only a modest increase in the demand for balancing energy will make coordination profitable. If the supply curve for balancing energy is convex, so that the cost of balancing energy is asymmetric, the gains will be even higher. Finally, we find that day-ahead market bid curves that result from coordinated instances provide extra supply at low prices, and lower supply at high prices, compared to sequential bids. This is rational given the anticipated opportunities that the balancing market offers; however, it makes day-ahead bidding appear to exploit market power.},

The com puter generated data should be analyzed by computers; without the aid of computing technologies, it is certain that huge amounts of data collected will not ever be examined, let alone be used to our advantages. Even with today's advanced computer technologies (e. g. , machine learning and data mining sys tems), discovering knowledge from data can still be fiendishly hard due to the characteristics of the computer generated data. Taking its simplest form, raw data are represented in feature-values. The size of a dataset can be measUJ{$\cdot$}ed in two dimensions, number of features (N) and number of instances (P). Both Nand P can be enormously large. This enormity may cause serious problems to many data mining systems. Feature selection is one of the long existing methods that deal with these problems. Its objective is to select a minimal subset of features according to some reasonable criteria so that the original task can be achieved equally well, if not better. By choosing a minimal subset offeatures, irrelevant and redundant features are removed according to the criterion. When N is reduced, the data space shrinks and in a sense, the data set is now a better representative of the whole data population. If necessary, the reduction of N can also give rise to the reduction of P by eliminating duplicates.},

This study proposes a two-stage probabilistic framework for the prediction of system imbalance and imbalance price. In the first stage, the quantiles of system imbalance are predicted employing the Quantile Regression Forest algorithm. In the second stage, the quantiles are leveraged to predict the imbalance prices, given the observed correlation between the system imbalance and the imbalance prices. The corresponding imbalance prices for each 15-minute interval are then predicted utilizing a novel methodology that combines Gradient Boosting with Markov switching models. The proposed methodology was evaluated using real data from the Greek balancing market. Comparative analysis with alternative models including a persistence model, Quantile Linear Regression, Long Short-Term Memory, and Quantile Regression Forest reveals that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the rest in terms of forecast accuracy. Specifically, the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms all alternative methods, achieving an 9\% improvement in nMAE and a 10.8\% reduction in CRPS with respect to the second best method (Quantile Regression Forest). The findings suggest that this approach can significantly improve the decision-making process for market participants, helping mitigate the financial risks associated with imbalance prices.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the use of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), an ensemble-tree-based machine learning (ML) algorithm, for short-term forecasting of manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR) activation direction and imbalance prices in the SE2 price area of the Nordic electricity market. With growing electrification, a rising share of renewables and strain from the ongoing energy crisis, the ability to anticipate balancing needs has become both more critical and more complex. Despite its practical importance, this problem has been relatively underexplored in the academic literature. The objective of this study is to assess how ML can support Intraday (ID) decision-making and improve predictive capabilities. To achieve this, a two-stage forecasting framework was developed using XGBoost, with the first stage classifying the expected direction of mFRR activation (upregulated, downregulated or unregulated), and the second stage predicting the corresponding imbalance price. The models were trained on data collected between May 2022 and February 2025 and evaluated across multiple forecasting horizons. By systematically testing preprocessing techniques, data availability, model configurations and feature sets and validating assumptions through domain knowledge, this study makes valuable contributions to the field. The results demonstrate that creating a model with normalized transmission flows, including forecasting error features, and data from SE1, SE2, SE3 and NO4 yielded the best results. Forward filling for missing values, avoiding outlier removal, applying simple ordinal time encoding, and relying on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection further improved performance. Leveraging a wide set of features and optimizing hyperparameters through Bayesian optimization, enhanced model performance. More specifically, the classification model achieved {$FF$}1{$mmmmmmmmmm$} scores of 0.805, 0.611 and 0.531 for one-, two- and three-hour ahead forecasts. While predictive performance declined at longer horizons, class-specific Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) scores indicated that meaningful signals were retained up to five hours into the future and that prediction thresholds could be further optimized per class. With regards to the imbalance price model, one-hour forecasts yielded acceptable results. This model reached a Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) of 0.366 and a Coefficient of Determination ({$RR$}2) of 0.667 for the one-hour ahead forecast. Overall, the study concludes that XGBoost models, supported by rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection and hyperparameter optimization, can provide valuable short-term forecasts in the context of imbalance prediction.},

  abstract = {Dealing with missingness in time series data is a very important, but oftentimes overlooked, step in data analysis. In this paper, the nature of time series data and missingness mechanisms are described to help identify which imputation method should be used to impute missing data, along with a review of imputation methods and how they work. Recommended methods from literature are used to impute synthetic data of different nature and the results are discussed. In addition, a case study concerning the prediction (classification) of US market instability (BEAR or BULL) using a data set with mixed missingness mechanisms and mixed nature is presented to evaluate how different types of imputation methods can affect the final results of the classification task.},

  abstract = {Power system balancing becomes ever-challenging due to the increasing penetration of uncertain renewable energy sources. Therefore, balancing markets are implemented in various power markets and such markets play a crucial role in ensuring balanced system operation. The optimal operation of balancing market necessitates accurate imbalance volume forecasts. However, imbalance volume forecasting got less research attention. Also, most of the existing imbalance volume forecasting models do not use specific input selection or data preprocessing techniques. These techniques can help to improve forecasting accuracy. Further, balancing market operations necessitates short-term forecasts. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel dynamic regression-based Trigonometric Seasonal, Yeo-Johnson Transformation, ARMA residuals, Trend, and Seasonality (TYJATS) forecasting model to obtain accurate short-term imbalance volume forecasts. The proposed forecasting model dynamically updates data at each time step, effectively handling seasonality and nonlinearity. It uses Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) for input data selection and the tsrobprep package for data preprocessing. Further, a Newton--Raphson-based optimizer (NRBO) is proposed to minimize the balancing costs. The proposed model is tested on the data collected from the Belgian market. The forecasting analysis demonstrates that the proposed model improves accuracy by 59.85\%, 42.61\%, and 39.56\% compared to machine learning (long short-term memory), regression (auto-regressive distributed lag), and Transmission System Operator (TSO)-based forecasting, respectively. Furthermore, integrating the proposed forecasting model into balancing market optimization results in the least balancing cost, achieving savings of 44.51\% compared to TSO-based forecasting.},

  abstract = {Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed. Additional resources related to event prediction are included in the paper website: http://cs.emory.edu/{$\sim$}lzhao41/projects/event\_prediction\_site.html.},
